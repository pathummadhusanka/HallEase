> ## Frontend

### 1. User Management

- User Registration Form (Signup):

        Create a form using React to capture user details (email, password, role).

- Login Form:

        Create a login form and handle JWT token storage in localStorage or cookies.

- Admin Dashboard:

        Build the admin dashboard UI to manage halls, bookings, and users.

- User Profile Page (optional):

        Allow users to view and update their profile information.

**Role-Based Access Control:**

Define roles: **admin, user** in the user model (MongoDB).
 - admins have all the privillages like accept a reservation or reject a reservation
 - users have limited privillages.
 if we want to categories users then we can differentiate between student and lecturers

### 2. Hall Booking

- Hall List View:
 
        Create a view to list all halls with basic details (name, capacity, availability).

- Booking Form:

        Build a booking form where users can select the hall, date, time, and event details.

        Add client-side form validation (e.g., ensuring event end time is after the start time).

- Booking Modification/Cancelation:

        Add functionality for users and admins to modify or cancel bookings via a modal or edit form.

### 3. Calendar & Graphical Representation

- Calendar View:

        Use a calendar library (e.g., FullCalendar for React) to display hall bookings.

        Ensure bookings are color-coded based on status (booked, available, canceled).

        Add filters (date, hall) to customize calendar views.

- Graphical Representation (Optional):

        If opting for a graphical view of halls, use a library like D3.js or Three.js to visualize hall layouts.

        Highlight hall details on hover/click (e.g., capacity, availability).


### 4. Notifications and Alerts

- Email Notification Setup:

        Inform users via a confirmation screen that an email/SMS has been sent after a successful booking.

- Reminder Notifications:

        Show pop-up or toast notifications for reminders on the user dashboard.

### 5. AI/ML Features
